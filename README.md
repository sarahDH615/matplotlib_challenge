### description:
* Three observations are made on the data in the pharmaceutical study.
* Data is cleaned, removing duplicates
* Creation of a summary statistics table divided by drug regimen, using two methods of generating summary statistics (groupby and .agg)
* Bar charts are created showing the total number of measurements taken for each drug regimen (done twice: once using plt.plot, and the other using pd.df.plot)
* Pie charts are created showing the distribution of male/female mice in the study (done twice: once using plt.plot, and the other using pd.df.plot)
* Quartiles and potential outliers are calculated for final tumor volume per mouse, and box plots are created to illustrate the data
* A line plot was created for the tumor volume over time of an arbitrary mouse undergoing the Capomulin regimen
* A scatter plot was created showing average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen, and a Linear Regression was performed upon it.
